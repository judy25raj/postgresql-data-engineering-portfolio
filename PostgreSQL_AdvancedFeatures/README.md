## 🧠 Overview
This project demonstrates advanced PostgreSQL capabilities through a series of practical data and logic exercises, including trigger-based auditing, large-scale text processing, bulk data generation, and a conceptual hash collision puzzle.

The implementation showcases how PostgreSQL can be extended beyond basic queries to support data integrity, automation, analytics, and security-oriented thinking.

## 🎯 Capabilities Demonstrated
- Audit-style triggers to automatically update metadata  
- Regular expression filtering on large text datasets  
- Bulk synthetic data generation using PL/pgSQL loops  
- Conceptual hash collision analysis for security awareness  

## 🛠 Environment
The project can be executed on:

- A local PostgreSQL instance (recommended)  
- The course-hosted PostgreSQL environment  

**Example (local):**
```bash
createdb pg_project4
psql pg_project4
