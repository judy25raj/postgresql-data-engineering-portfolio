<h1 align="center">PostgreSQL Relationships – Many-to-Many Modeling</h1>

<p align="center">
  Relational Modeling • Junction Tables • Normalization • SQL-Only ETL
</p>

<hr/>

## 🧠 Overview
This project demonstrates how to design and implement **many-to-many relationships** in PostgreSQL using normalized schemas and junction tables.

Two real-world modeling scenarios are implemented:

- **Course Roster** — students enrolled in multiple courses with roles  
- **Music Library** — tracks associated with multiple artists  

The project showcases best practices for relational modeling, data normalization, and SQL-based transformation workflows.

## 🎯 Capabilities Demonstrated
- Many-to-many schema design using junction tables  
- Foreign key constraints with referential integrity  
- Data normalization from denormalized text columns  
- S
